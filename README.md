# MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification using PyTorch. The model is designed to achieve >95% accuracy in a single epoch while maintaining less than 25,000 parameters.

## Model Architecture

- 2 Convolutional layers
- 3 Fully connected layers
- ReLU activation
- MaxPooling

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- pytest
